# 🔠 Project: Categorizing Algorithms in C++

## 📝 Overview
This C++ project focuses on implementing and testing **two sorting algorithms** and **two searching algorithms** through an interactive menu-driven program. It allows the user to:
- Enter an array
- Sort it using Selection or Merge Sort
- Search using Linear or Binary Search
- View the array
- Exit the program gracefully

---

## 🖥️ Features
- 📚 Selection Sort and Merge Sort
- 🔍 Linear Search and Binary Search
- 📊 Interactive menu for operations
- 🚫 Binary search warning on unsorted data
- ✅ Clean exit confirmation

---
